This code loads the required packages:

```{r}
library(C50)
library(printr)
```

This code takes a sample of 100 rows from the iris dataset:
```{r}
train.indices <- sample(1:nrow(iris), 100)
iris.train <- iris[train.indices,]
iris.test <- iris[-train.indices,]
```

This code trains a model based on the training data:
```{r}
model <- C5.0(Species ~ ., data = iris.train)
```
---
tilde means depends. here Species depends on all other cols
---

This code tests the model using the test data:
 
```{r}
results <- predict(object = model, newdata = iris.test, type="class")
```

This code generates a confusion matrix
```{r}
table(results, iris.test$Species)
```
